# social-good-datathon
This is our project for the 2019 Social Good Datathon hosted by Data Science Society at Berkeley and IBM.

We have 2 files for data exploration and building out our algorithm:
HomeSafe_metrics.ipynb - This notebook includes all the functions that we built out to create our final algorithm, along with a basic user interface.
DataExploration.ipynb - This notebook shows the exploratory data analysis that we conducted.

We have 2 files that contain data:
crime2.csv - This is the final data we used, after keeping only data on severe/violent crimes.
Berkeley_crime_2018.csv - This is the original data, from Berkeley Police Dept.
