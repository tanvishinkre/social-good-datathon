# social-good-datathon
This is our project for the 2019 Social Good Datathon hosted by Data Science Society at Berkeley and IBM, hosted over 24 hours from November 8th to November 9th.

We have 2 files for data exploration and building out our algorithm:
HomeSafe_metrics.ipynb - This notebook includes all the functions that we built out to create our final algorithm, along with a basic user interface.
DataExploration.ipynb - This notebook shows the exploratory data analysis that we conducted.

We have 2 files that contain data:
crime2.csv - This is the final data we used, after keeping only data on severe/violent crimes.
Berkeley_crime_2018.csv - This is the original data, from Berkeley Police Dept (https://data.cityofberkeley.info/Public-Safety/Berkeley-PD-Calls-for-Service/k2nh-s5h5).
