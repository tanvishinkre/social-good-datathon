# social-good-datathon
This is our project for the 2019 Social Good Datathon hosted by Data Science Society at Berkeley and IBM.

We have 2 files for data exploration and building out our algorithm:
HomeSafe_metrics.ipynb - This notebook includes all the functions that we built out to create our final algorithm, along with a basic user interface
DataExploration.ipynb - This notebook shows the exploratory data analysis that we conducted.
crimes2.csv - This is the data we used.
